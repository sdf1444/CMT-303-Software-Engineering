# Opportunity Project

A test creator and marking application for multiple choice tests up to 20 questions.  Made in Python 3.7 and Tkinter.

Introduction:

With cohort sizes growing, the marking workload for lecturers is increasing. Although automated making of assessment is not desirable for all assessments, the assessment of knowledge and understanding of a topic often can be automated. As a school, staff are being encouraged to consider automated marking were appropriate to provide students with more timely feedback. Staffs are also being encouraged to provide formative assessment opportunities which allow students to gain a better idea of their understanding of a module or topic area. Learning central does provide facilities for online tests but many staff does not like the learning central interface and so are turned off trying this. We need a system that provides an assessment test that can be Summative or Formative depending on the needs of the module, lecturers and Students.

Run create_ManageTest.py in src file to run the Tkinter GUI.
